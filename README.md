# ABSTRACT
The growth of online strength and conditioning sites can be seen with the increased usage of both personal smart devices with athletes and tablets in the weight room. Sports teams and fitness professionals are investing in best-in-class online strength and conditioning for multiple reasons, mainly to improve time efficiency and communication with their athletes. Fitness professionals are the demanding for a specialized site to help improve the results of correspondence training or private live training. Legacy solutions, specifically spreadsheet or shared document software, have benefits, but they are not as effective as full packages.

In this Online Strength and Conditioning Site‚Äù PANDA FIT‚Äù, we cover the key benefits of using strength and conditioning software in detail. In addition to its advantages, we present essential principles that make the site even more powerful if utilized correctly and consistently. Strength and conditioning sites are no longer a luxury‚Äîtoday it‚Äôs instrumental in keeping athletes and clients supported properly. We‚Äôve integrated a special BMI calculator which calculates the BMI and also gives us a feedback weather we‚Äôre underweight, overweight or obese. We‚Äôve also featured a blog page where in specialized blogs on fitness and various other topics are posted.
This Site has used several GIFs to instruct the user on how to perform the exercises.


Overall, Its a One Stop Solution for all your Fitness Needs.
